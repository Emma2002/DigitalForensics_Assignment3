Because big teams worked for me for a smaller percentage, and I still have to earn something on administration.Your locker fell into my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it&#39;s not bad, so I wrote.If you have a more interesting suggestion for%, then I&#39;m ready to consider it. &quot;We brought the pentesters to Khorsa there, found a few more coders this week, the recruitment is slowly moving forward.

SMTP will be taken into account 6. profile creation will be taken into account 7. Mail distribution goes through GET requests for fast distribution of large volumes of letters 100.000 thousand, 200.000 thousand. === This is a children&#39;s option - any mail server will immediately shut down such activity. Here in this article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ a working option is described - you will need to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account sent by an emulator with AI that simulates mouse movements , similar to human. Each mailer now has AI, it recognizes all movements in the browser and over the get-requests for sending hundreds of thousands of letters, their AI will simply laugh out loud. 8. the moment with authorization by cookies without a password is correct, I noticed this a long time ago when working with stealers, load cookies and just log in to your account repetitions, if the proxy is more, then 1 acc 1 proxy. === If you change the ip in aka, problems with logging in will immediately begin, it is better to refuse this option, the ideal option is docker with vpn. 10.

I paid for these servers and they were turned on after 10 minutes, everything is ok. it seems like the defender wrote to me the next day that frank complained about me and in general these servers are important. I explained the situation to him too, the defender himself told me about their importance for the first time, agreed that I would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there were no showdowns, there was no more dialogue with Frank except for the extension, only he, apparently, also wrote to Francis who sent me to you. Before that, there were situations too, but I took measures, I did an inventory for a month, demolished the system, updated all the lists, there are no problems. Frank&#39;s servers are my responsibility, I had to contact him myself, but I did not think that they were needed at all\n",

      "We have developed a painless concept for data analysis and calls / blackmail. I proposed the following scheme to Buza: We have a separate rocket for reconnaissance. there is a group on requests - there hackers are asked to put pressure on or prepare this or that company. we pass it on to analysts, they make a dossier report. if blackmail\\calls is required - we transfer this task to the callers. In order for callers to work efficiently and not call into the air, as it is happening right now - they are in touch with analysts, they can ask them for any additional data, for example, part of the date listing, or some kind of information about computers / passwords. If the company does not make contact, its data is transmitted further, for publication on the site. (for this you need to bring either a reshaev or some of his support into this chat) the essence of the problem with calls is such that most often when calling, the caller ends up at the reception where some kind of tpshka does not know the situation at all. and in fact, we just came out of nowhere with such a call, we need some kind of proof to get a result, and not just to hang up or send calls .. In principle, everything is already working, you just need to tune it up and so that hackers start using it. I pulled a gang of dereke, horse, and even pull up the reverse ..\n",

We find a place where crypto holders communicate (discord, etc.). Find out the IP of the node. Most likely it will be IPv6. We start ddosing. We fly into the chat that we found earlier and write that there are problems, the crypt is not displayed, operations are not carried out. (because the crypto depends on mining, there will really be problems). Holders start to get nervous and bring out the main balance. Crypto falls in price. We buy at a low price. We release ddos. Crypto is growing again. We are on the plus side. Or a variant of a letter to the creators about the possibility of a ransom if they want the ddos to end.

Developers (we), in principle, can act as witnesses. At the first stage without sharding, I think we will do it. Let it be for now.\n",

Should launch next week. Tom also seems to be starting from PND, we provided him with everything he needed. I got an offer from supposedly competitors, crylock partner - they say they broke down there, they have pentesters, targets, they only need a locker.

And now we have a hitch there and we will rewrite it &quot;It&#39;s a long time. So in order to keep my work alive, I&#39;m looking for a new locker partner. I have several teams of pentesters, several independent pentesters and my own targets, all kinds. I only need a locker, but in fact 30% will not suit me. Because big teams worked for me for a smaller percentage, and I still have to earn something on administration.Your locker fell into my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it&#39;s not bad, so I wrote.If you have a more interesting suggestion for%, then I&#39;m ready to consider it. &quot;We brought the pentesters to Khorsa there, found a few more coders this week, the recruitment is slowly moving forward.

Weldon conjures over the antique, removes hanks and errors, immediately checking whether the project will be assembled. By injection under VNC: The problem of not loading some sites, or loading in the wrong form, associated with inserting our code into html. As a result of the work, a lot of ssl certificates and a cache are created, while some of them are updated, and some are not. At the same time, the criteria for such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in recreating the problem situation on the test machine. As a result, if Chrome has not updated the cache, our certificate does not suit it, some of the pieces are taken normally, some are not, a conflict occurs, resulting in a page break. This needs to be checked with the config encoder. Even today, Jaime has assembled an assembly to combat the privacy error, Robin will throw off the addresses that need to be checked. Otherwise, no big changes so far. Well, there were also problems with detections on triples, but this was overcome at the moment, today the triple is without them.\n",

I think it will be a good move, I just remember the times when I myself lil - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delay) and the second moment is the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours.

Weldon conjures over the antique, removes hanks and errors, immediately checking whether the project will be assembled. By injection under VNC: The problem of not loading some sites, or loading in the wrong form, associated with inserting our code into html. As a result of the work, a lot of ssl certificates and a cache are created, while some of them are updated, and some are not. At the same time, the criteria for such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in recreating the problem situation on the test machine. As a result, if Chrome has not updated the cache, our certificate does not suit it, some of the pieces are taken normally, some are not, a conflict occurs, resulting in a page break. This needs to be checked with the config encoder. Even today, Jaime has assembled an assembly to combat the privacy error, Robin will throw off the addresses that need to be checked. Otherwise, no big changes so far. Well, there were also problems with detections on triples, but this was overcome at the moment, today the triple is without them.\n",

Mail names are generated based on macros === I have done much cooler 3. captcha is not taken into account yet, we will take into account 4. proxy is a weak option, there will be nordvpn or amazon lambdas (as in cart) in the docker 5. SMTP will be taken into account 6. profile creation will be taken into account 7. Mail distribution goes through GET requests for fast distribution of large volumes of letters 100.000 thousand, 200.000 thousand. === This is a children&#39;s option - any mail server will immediately shut down such activity. Here in this article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ a working option is described - you will need to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account sent by an emulator with AI that simulates mouse movements , similar to human. Each mailer now has AI, it recognizes all movements in the browser and over the get-requests for sending hundreds of thousands of letters, their AI will simply laugh out loud. 8. the moment with authorization by cookies without a password is correct, I noticed this a long time ago when working with stealers, load cookies and just log in to your account repetitions, if the proxy is more, then 1 acc 1 proxy. === If you change the ip in aka, problems with logging in will immediately begin, it is better to refuse this option, the ideal option is docker with vpn. 10.

SMTP will be taken into account 6. profile creation will be taken into account 7. Mail distribution goes through GET requests for fast distribution of large volumes of letters 100.000 thousand, 200.000 thousand. === This is a children&#39;s option - any mail server will immediately shut down such activity. Here in this article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ a working option is described - you will need to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account sent by an emulator with AI that simulates mouse movements , similar to human. Each mailer now has AI, it recognizes all movements in the browser and over the get-requests for sending hundreds of thousands of letters, their AI will simply laugh out loud. 8. the moment with authorization by cookies without a password is correct, I noticed this a long time ago when working with stealers, load cookies and just log in to your account repetitions, if the proxy is more, then 1 acc 1 proxy. === If you change the ip in aka, problems with logging in will immediately begin, it is better to refuse this option, the ideal option is docker with vpn. 10. Generating PDF files with macros + using wkhtmltopdf === this is not required, pappetir knows how to do it from birth, the rest, it seems, everything is normal TK - practically new, a lot of additions, accepted for execution\n",

I paid for these servers and they were turned on after 10 minutes, everything is ok. it seems like the defender wrote to me the next day that frank complained about me and in general these servers are important. I explained the situation to him too, the defender himself told me about their importance for the first time, agreed that I would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there were no showdowns, there was no more dialogue with Frank except for the extension, only he, apparently, also wrote to Francis who sent me to you. Before that, there were situations too, but I took measures, I did an inventory for a month, demolished the system, updated all the lists, there are no problems.

If I understand the software device correctly, I need an injector, pvgrab, importdll. What other modules are vital in the config? 4. Contacted Khors about admins - he clarified the task, He says we need pentesters rather than admins. And at 6 in the morning, a great idea came to my beautiful and drunk head where to get them :) Do you remember the revils were promoted for damage - they threw lam bucks in cue balls on a deposit and then they started to break the topic - they wrote there that they were inviting teams of hackers / pentesters to work with them. They wrote 5 pages of the topic with suggestions! They write something like that. &quot;Team 3 people experience, etc&quot; and there are a lot of them 5 or more even pages! That&#39;s where we&#39;ll take them! I will spam personals with a job offer for them all + many people left contacts there themselves (although everyone has toxins). By the 10th it will be done.

I paid for these servers and after 10 minutes they turned on everything ok. it seems like the defender wrote to me the next day that frank complained about me and in general these servers are important. I explained the situation to him too, the defender himself told me about their importance for the first time, agreed that I would renew and ask customers about an extension when ordering, there were no showdowns, there was no more dialogue with Frank except for the extension, only he, apparently, also wrote to Francis who sent me to you. Before that, there were situations too, but I took measures, I did an inventory for a month, demolished the system, updated all the lists, there are no problems.

      "Hello, I am writing to you off. Our old case was resumed, the investigator said why it was resumed, the Americans officially requested information about Russian hackers, not only about us, but in general who was caught in the country. Actually, they are interested in the trickbot, and some other viruses. On the following Tuesday, the investigator called us for a conversation, but for the time being, like as witnesses. But for now we will be at 51. Even as the investigator said, the case was extended until the end of October in order to have a conversation with us. Since if the case is suspended, they cannot interrogate us in any way, and, as a matter of fact, because of this, they resumed it. We have already contacted our lawyers. Question: Would it be possible to get a salary? What would I do to extend my lawyer right now and go on vacation until the end of October? To destroy all this bullshit. The only thing I will go to issuing routers every day. I give them to thunder and defu.\n",

Just no offense, if anything, I&#39;m sorry. Can you please send the second part of the sn if it&#39;s not difficult? I just want to pay off the loan. As the stern will be, I will write to him that you threw off the salary, but how would you be against it. We communicate well with him. No matter how we work for the first day. Chef, well, you breed this garbage yourself, you feel sorry for everyone, but they get used to it and sit on their necks. It is necessary that you be online more often and in some situations, FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, be harder. And it turns out that we are playing bad / good cop here, I’m fussing around here, fucking their brains so that everyone works, I swear when I see that there is no result, and then you come and feel sorry for all of them, warm, although there is no result from them . Everyone will get used to the fact that you can cry to Stern and he will forgive, give money. I will not teach you, you yourself know everything, just reminded once again.\n",
