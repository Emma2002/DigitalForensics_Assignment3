SMTP will be taken into account 6. profile creation will be taken into account 7. Mail distribution goes through GET requests for fast distribution of large volumes of letters 100.000 thousand, 200.000 thousand. === This is a children&#39;s option - any mail server will immediately shut down such activity. Here in this article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ a working option is described - you will need to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account sent by an emulator with AI that simulates mouse movements , similar to human. Each mailer now has AI, it recognizes all movements in the browser and over the get-requests for sending hundreds of thousands of letters, their AI will simply laugh out loud. 8. the moment with authorization by cookies without a password is correct, I noticed this a long time ago when working with stealers, load cookies and just log in to your account repetitions, if the proxy is more, then 1 acc 1 proxy. === If you change the ip in aka, problems with logging in will immediately begin, it is better to refuse this option, the ideal option is docker with vpn. 10.

      "hi, yesterday francis said that due to a complaint my salary is in question now and you need to write. last week frank asked to renew two of his test servers, they were not in the renewal, because in August he said &quot;..we&#39;ll see..&quot; about them, I don&#39;t remember exactly. I paid for these servers and they were turned on after 10 minutes, everything is ok. it seems like the defender wrote to me the next day that frank complained about me and in general these servers are important. I explained the situation to him too, the defender himself told me about their importance for the first time, agreed that I would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there were no showdowns, there was no more dialogue with Frank except for the extension, only he, apparently, also wrote to Francis who sent me to you. Before that, there were situations too, but I took measures, I did an inventory for a month, demolished the system, updated all the lists, there are no problems. Frank&#39;s servers are my responsibility, I had to contact him myself, but I did not think that they were needed at all\n",

      "We have developed a painless concept for data analysis and calls / blackmail. I proposed the following scheme to Buza: We have a separate rocket for reconnaissance. there is a group on requests - there hackers are asked to put pressure on or prepare this or that company. we pass it on to analysts, they make a dossier report. if blackmail\\calls is required - we transfer this task to the callers. In order for callers to work efficiently and not call into the air, as it is happening right now - they are in touch with analysts, they can ask them for any additional data, for example, part of the date listing, or some kind of information about computers / passwords. If the company does not make contact, its data is transmitted further, for publication on the site. (for this you need to bring either a reshaev or some of his support into this chat) the essence of the problem with calls is such that most often when calling, the caller ends up at the reception where some kind of tpshka does not know the situation at all. and in fact, we just came out of nowhere with such a call, we need some kind of proof to get a result, and not just to hang up or send calls .. In principle, everything is already working, you just need to tune it up and so that hackers start using it. I pulled a gang of dereke, horse, and even pull up the reverse ..\n",

We find a place where crypto holders communicate (discord, etc.). Find out the IP of the node. Most likely it will be IPv6. We start ddosing. We fly into the chat that we found earlier and write that there are problems, the crypt is not displayed, operations are not carried out. (because the crypto depends on mining, there will really be problems). Holders start to get nervous and bring out the main balance. Crypto falls in price. We buy at a low price. We release ddos. Crypto is growing again. We are on the plus side. Or a variant of a letter to the creators about the possibility of a ransom if they want the ddos to end.

Should launch next week. Tom also seems to be starting from PND, we provided him with everything he needed. I got an offer from supposedly competitors, crylock partner - they say they broke down there, they have pentesters, targets, they only need a locker.

And now we have a hitch there and we will rewrite it &quot;It&#39;s a long time. So in order to keep my work alive, I&#39;m looking for a new locker partner. I have several teams of pentesters, several independent pentesters and my own targets, all kinds. I only need a locker, but in fact 30% will not suit me. Because big teams worked for me for a smaller percentage, and I still have to earn something on administration.Your locker fell into my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it&#39;s not bad, so I wrote.If you have a more interesting suggestion for%, then I&#39;m ready to consider it. &quot;We brought the pentesters to Khorsa there, found a few more coders this week, the recruitment is slowly moving forward.

Weldon conjures over the antique, removes hanks and errors, immediately checking whether the project will be assembled. By injection under VNC: The problem of not loading some sites, or loading in the wrong form, associated with inserting our code into html. As a result of the work, a lot of ssl certificates and a cache are created, while some of them are updated, and some are not. At the same time, the criteria for such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in recreating the problem situation on the test machine. As a result, if Chrome has not updated the cache, our certificate does not suit it, some of the pieces are taken normally, some are not, a conflict occurs, resulting in a page break. This needs to be checked with the config encoder. Even today, Jaime has assembled an assembly to combat the privacy error, Robin will throw off the addresses that need to be checked. Otherwise, no big changes so far. Well, there were also problems with detections on triples, but this was overcome at the moment, today the triple is without them.\n",

I think it will be a good move, I just remember the times when I myself lil - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delay) and the second moment is the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours.

Weldon conjures over the antique, removes hanks and errors, immediately checking whether the project will be assembled. By injection under VNC: The problem of not loading some sites, or loading in the wrong form, associated with inserting our code into html. As a result of the work, a lot of ssl certificates and a cache are created, while some of them are updated, and some are not. At the same time, the criteria for such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in recreating the problem situation on the test machine. As a result, if Chrome has not updated the cache, our certificate does not suit it, some of the pieces are taken normally, some are not, a conflict occurs, resulting in a page break. This needs to be checked with the config encoder. Even today, Jaime has assembled an assembly to combat the privacy error, Robin will throw off the addresses that need to be checked. Otherwise, no big changes so far. Well, there were also problems with detections on triples, but this was overcome at the moment, today the triple is without them.\n",

Mail distribution goes through GET requests for fast distribution of large volumes of letters 100.000 thousand, 200.000 thousand. === This is a children&#39;s option - any mail server will immediately shut down such activity. Here in this article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ a working option is described - you will need to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account sent by an emulator with AI that simulates mouse movements , similar to human. Each mailer now has AI, it recognizes all movements in the browser and over the get-requests for sending hundreds of thousands of letters, their AI will simply laugh out loud. 8. the moment with authorization by cookies without a password is correct, I noticed this a long time ago when working with stealers, load cookies and just log in to your account repetitions, if the proxy is more, then 1 acc 1 proxy. === If you change the ip in aka, problems with logging in will immediately begin, it is better to refuse this option, the ideal option is docker with vpn. 10.

But then it turned out that their blockchain (on the DAG) is based on witnesses, which are Google and others. twelve witnesses. There will be no witnesses, there will be no blockchain. I found a video with a lecture by one of the Byteball developers. He spoke very unconvincingly about this case. The audience was also, in my opinion, disappointed. Witnesses must constantly add their transactions to the DAG 24/7. This is how I testify to the past. If you later add a transaction with re-spending and parents from the past, then there will be no witnesses on the way to it and it will be unusable. The blockchain is written entirely in js. DB in mysql. To deploy a full client, you need to rent a server, install everything on it, get a certificate for SSL. Network exchange goes on https. Although I had the idea of the client working through an anonymously obtained server. I&#39;m thinking about it. 2. Since I still didn’t decide on which blockchain principle to stop, I started watching polkadot. This blockchain is written in Rust. The language is new. In general, I am a conservative in programming languages, as I stuck to c ++, I live. But I need to deal with the blockchain, so I downloaded the Rust tutorial, installed the compiler and have been studying for the third day. Rust is said to be very suitable for blockchain development. We&#39;ll see. If this is true, and this language increases the productivity of programmers, then why not. 3. NFT also surfaced. Must watch. 4. What I have determined for myself. Blockchain should be done on DAG. The unit of record in the DAG will not be a block with a bunch of transactions, but a single transaction. Any entity can be in a transaction: a transfer of coins, a smart contract, some kind of token (NFT). As a mysql DB, probably. Has not yet resolved the issue of double spending, witnesses. Developers (we), in principle, can act as witnesses. At the first stage without sharding, I think we will do it. Let it be for now.\n",

Mail distribution goes through GET requests for fast distribution of large volumes of letters 100.000 thousand, 200.000 thousand. === This is a children&#39;s option - any mail server will immediately shut down such activity. Here in this article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ a working option is described - you will need to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account sent by an emulator with AI that simulates mouse movements , similar to human. Each mailer now has AI, it recognizes all movements in the browser and over the get-requests for sending hundreds of thousands of letters, their AI will simply laugh out loud. 8. the moment with authorization by cookies without a password is correct, I noticed this a long time ago when working with stealers, load cookies and just log in to your account repetitions, if the proxy is more, then 1 acc 1 proxy. === If you change the ip in aka, problems with logging in will immediately begin, it is better to refuse this option, the ideal option is docker with vpn. 10.
